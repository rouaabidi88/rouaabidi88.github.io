                <h3>Cybersecurity Analyst Intern</h3>
                <p> The journey at EY as a cybersecurity analyst intern lasted for 1 month as a summer internship. My main focus was on EY's csirt (Computer Security Incident Response Team) OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) solution. I contributed by developing
                    a Django API that facilitates the collection of intelligence information related to files, URLs, IP addresses, or domain names. The API leveraged various tools such as VirusTotal, Shodan, urlscan, and deep web search to assess the
                    security status of provided files or IP addresses, ensuring their safety.
                </p>
                <h3>Cybersecurity Analyst</h3>
                <p> The cybersecurity analyst journey at EY spanned a duration of 3 months, encompassing multiple responsibilities. I actively contributed to enhancing the Django API of EY's OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) solution. In addition, I deepened
                    the search for information by integrating MISP analyzers and various trusted OSINT solutions. During this time, I also had the opportunity to participate in EY's penetration testing missions. Specifically, I served as a red team member
                    in two network services pentest missions. My primary focus involved automating MITM (Man in the Middle) attack techniques. Within the company's network, I developed automated processes for installing packet sniffers capable of analyzing
                    and identifying insecure network communications to redirect the communication flow to an untrusted party. Throughout this experience, I played an active role in advancing EY's cybersecurity measures, strengthening their OSINT capabilities,
                    and contributing to the success of network services pentest missions.

                <p>Siyou Technology, an Italian company, specializes in innovative e-commerce solutions with a focus on B2S2C (Business to Supplier to Consumers) models. Their objective is to enhance business flexibility by creating a diverse range of B2B
                    (Business to Business) and B2C (Business to Consumer) solutions that are compatible with various devices.</br>
                    </br>
                    During my 2-month summer internship as a software engineering intern at Siyou, my journey involved working on a B2B solution focused on managing the sales flow of a market business. This solution encompassed various functionalities such as authentication
                    through Google, Facebook, or email, local shop search capabilities, order placement, profile and order management, as well as handling payments.</br>
                    </br>
                    For the API development of the B2B solution at Siyou, I utilized Django, a Python-based web framework known for its robustness and scalability. With Django, I created the backend API endpoints to handle various functionalities and data operations. In
                    the front-end development, I utilized Flutter, a popular cross-platform framework for building user interfaces. Flutter allowed me to develop the client-side application with a single codebase that could run on both iOS and Android
                    devices, providing a seamless and consistent user experience. To store and manage the data for the B2B solution, I employed PostgreSQL, a powerful and open-source relational database management system. PostgreSQL offered reliability,
                    data integrity, and the ability to handle complex queries and transactions required for the application. By combining Django for API development, Flutter for front-end development, and PostgreSQL as the database, I was able to create
                    a comprehensive and efficient system for the B2B solution at Siyou.

                <h2 class="major">ChaosFieldz Documentation</h2>
                <p>ChaosFieldz is a sci-fi-themed battle royale game with a gameplay average duration of 15 minutes. The game accommodates up to 40 players who are placed in a sci-fi village environment. Players must scavenge the map for crucial survival
                    pickups, including water, medkits, backpacks, weapons, and grenades. Strategic decision-making, such as determining the opportune moments to engage in combat or conceal oneself, becomes vital for survival in this intense gameplay experience.</p>
                <h3 class="major">Player Setup : </h3>
                <h4>Animation System</h4>
                <p>The project incorporates an advanced animation blueprint setup for the player character, offering a range of fluid animations. This includes walking, sprinting, crouching, and various interactions with weapons, such as equipping, unequipping,
                    aiming, firing, reloading, and throwing grenades. Moreover, the player character can interact with pickups like medkits for healing and water for hydration. The system also accounts for damage-taking mechanics, triggering appropriate
                    animations for the victim player, and celebratory animations for the scoring player. The comprehensive animation blueprint setup enhances the overall gameplay experience and adds visual depth to the project.
                </p>
                <h4>Objects Interaction</h4>
                <p>The object interaction in the game is facilitated by pressing the designated hotkey "E". Depending on the nature of the object, the interaction process varies. If the object is a backpack, it will be attached to the player's back. Alternatively,
                    if it is a weapon, it will be attached to the player's hands for immediate use. In the case of pickups, such as consumables or items, they will be added to the player's backpack, and the inventory system will handle the interaction.
                    This interaction process also updates the in-game widget, providing real-time information about the player's inventory status.</p>
                <h3 class="major">Weaponry System : </h3>
                <p>The weaponry system in the game comprises various components, including weapons, ammo, magazines, and grenades. There are five types of weapons available: Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Sniper, and Grenade Launcher, alongside a pistol. Each weapon
                    possesses unique characteristics such as distinct firing and reloading animations, visual effects, default damage, range, magazine capacity, and ammo type. The Sniper weapon comes equipped with an 8X scope, enhancing precision for
                    long-range engagements. On the other hand, the Grenade Launcher allows players to choose the location of the grenade to be launched by utilizing the mouse's scroll wheel. To initiate firing, players utilize the left mouse button. The
                    system verifies if the weapon has sufficient ammo, and if the condition is met, it executes a line trace starting from the weapon's muzzle. Depending on the range of the weapon, the line trace detects and registers hits on the target.
                    In the case of the Grenade Launcher, it launches a grenade projectile that accurately delivers the explosive to the designated target location. By incorporating these mechanics, the game provides engaging and realistic shooting experiences
                    with distinct weapons and their associated functionalities.</p>
                <h3 class="major">Multiplayer Setup : </h3>
                <p>The multiplayer setup in the game allows for player interactions, including dealing damage, taking damage, and broadcasting death events to all connected players. Initially, only one player can emerge as the winner until duo and squad
                    gameplay modes are introduced. The amount of damage a player receives is calculated based on several factors, including the specific bone hit in the player's skeleton, the distance between the two players, and the weapon utilized.
                    For instance, a shot to the head bone with a Rifle or Sniper results in a fatal headshot. Upon a player's death, their inventory objects such as pickups and weapons are dropped on the ground, becoming available for other players to
                    pick up and utilize. The multiplayer setup employs a relevancy-oriented approach. Players can observe others equipping, reloading, firing, and dropping their weapons, which provides relevant information for gameplay interactions. However,
                    they won't be able to see another player picking up a medkit since this information is not deemed relevant to their gameplay experience.</p>
                <h3 class="major">User Interface : </h3>
                <p>The user interface in the game consists of several components. Firstly, the main widget incorporates the player's aiming crosshair, providing a visual reference for precise targeting. Secondly, the inventory widget displays the counts
                    of various pickups, allowing players to monitor their available resources. The player stats widget is responsible for presenting important indicators such as health, stamina, hunger, and thirst. These vital parameters are represented
                    using progress bars, offering a clear visualization of the player's status. Lastly, the weapon widget provides essential information about the currently equipped weapon, including details such as the weapon's name, ammo count, and
                    an option to drop the weapon if desired. By incorporating these UI elements, players can easily access and monitor crucial information during gameplay, enhancing their overall experience and decision-making.</p>

                <h2 class="major">GalacticRush Documentation</h2>
                <p>In GalacticRush, players assume the role of Rosales, who finds themselves trapped in an ancient religious temple and relentlessly pursued by a mutant creature. The objective is to escape from the monster by navigating through the temple's
                    treacherous obstacles, while also collecting power-ups and coins along the way. These coins can later be used to purchase additional power-ups, further enhancing the player's chances of survival.</p>
                <h3 class="major">Player Setup : </h3>
                <h4>Animation System</h4>
                <p>The animation system revolves around player interactions with obstacles like running, turning left/right, rolling, high and low jumping as well as getting hit by obstacles like getting hit lightly and heavily as well as slipping in water.The
                    special animation part is the injury setup that launches on contact with a rock obstacle. The player runs, rolls and jums injured until healed.
                </p>
                <h4>Objects Interaction</h4>
                <p>During gameplay, players can interact with coins and power-ups. When the player overlaps with either a coin or a power-up, it is automatically collected and removed from the level. When interacting with a health or energy power-up, if
                    the player's immediate need for them is evident, they are automatically utilized. However, if the player doesn't require them immediately, they are added to the player's inventory, allowing them to choose when to use them at a later
                    time.
                </p>
                <h4>Damage System</h4>
                <p>The player in the game can sustain damage in three ways. Firstly, if the player gets hit by a fire branch or a water lake, they lose the game and are respawned for a new gameplay session. Secondly, being hit by a rock causes injury and
                    slows down the player's movement. This injury can be healed by utilizing health and energy power-ups. Lastly, if the player gets caught by the mutant, it results in a game loss.</p>
                <h3 class="major">Mutant Setup : </h3>
                <p>The mutant monster in the game is programmed to relentlessly chase the player. When the mutant gets extremely close to the player, it catches them, resulting in a game loss. However, after 4 seconds of initiating the chase, the mutant
                    disappears. If the player gets hit by an obstacle that doesn't lead to immediate death, the mutant reappears. The mutant has its own animation system and is hidden when it's not relevant to the current gameplay, optimizing GPU usage
                    and ensuring smoother gameplay experience.</p>
                <h3 class="major">User Interface : </h3>
                <p>The user interface (UI) in the game consists of several elements. Firstly, there is a score display that increments every second while the player is running, reflecting their progress. Additionally, there is a counter that keeps track
                    of the number of coins collected by the player. The UI also includes a visual representation of the player's energy level. Finally, an injury alarm is present to notify the player when they are injured and require attention.</p>
